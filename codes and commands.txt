 ðŸ”¹ Linux: Using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
1. Check if UFW is Installed & Enabled
sudo ufw status
If it says command not found, install it:
sudo apt install ufw -y

2. Enable UFW
sudo ufw enable
This will start enforcing firewall rules.

3. List Current Rules
sudo ufw status numbered
Youâ€™ll see something like:
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere

4. Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
Check rules again:
sudo ufw status numbered

5. Test the Rule
Try connecting to port 23 (it should fail):
telnet localhost 23
If telnet is not installed:
sudo apt install telnet -y
You should see:
Connection refused

6. Allow SSH (Port 22)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

7. Remove the Test Rule (Restore Original State)
Find the rule number:
sudo ufw status numbered
Then delete:
sudo ufw delete <rule_number>

8. How UFW Filters Traffic (Summary)
UFW works as a frontend for iptables.
It filters packets before they reach services.
Uses ALLOW or DENY rules for specific ports and protocols.
Works on inbound and outbound traffic separately.
Default policy: deny incoming, allow outgoing.
