sudo ufw status
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status numbered
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
telnet localhost 23
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw delete <rule_number>


1. Check and Install UFW
sudo ufw status
sudo apt install ufw -y

2. Enable UFW
sudo ufw enable

3. View Current Rules
sudo ufw status numbered

4. Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp

5. Test the Block Rule
telnet localhost 23
Expected output:
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

6. Allow SSH (Port 22)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

7. Remove the Test Rule
Find the rule number:
sudo ufw status numbered
Delete it:
sudo ufw delete <rule_number>

Firewall Filtering Summary
Function: UFW acts as a frontend for iptables, controlling network traffic.
Filtering Method: Uses rules to allow or deny packets based on port, protocol, and direction.
Default Policy: Deny incoming, allow outgoing.
Importance: Protects the system from unauthorized access and limits the attack surface.

Conclusion
The firewall was successfully configured to block Telnet (port 23) traffic and allow SSH (port 22) connections. Testing confirmed the rules worked as expected. The system was restored to its original firewall configuration after testing.
